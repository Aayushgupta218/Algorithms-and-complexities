Description:
This README introduces the Selection Sort algorithm implemented in C++ through an iterative approach. Selection Sort, a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm, is explored in detail to help users understand, implement, and evaluate its characteristics.

The iterative Selection Sort version employs a non-recursive strategy, utilizing loops to repeatedly find the minimum element and swap it with the current element. This approach is more efficient for larger datasets compared to the recursive counterpart. Users can refer to the comprehensive instructions provided for compiling, running, and assessing the performance of this iterative Selection Sort implementation.

Data Structures:

The primary data structure in the iterative strategy is an integer array. The iterative process iterates through the array, finding and swapping the minimum element, gradually achieving a sorted array.

Time Complexity:
The iterative Selection Sort implementation has an average time complexity of O(n^2), where "n" is the number of elements in the array. The simplicity of the algorithm results in quadratic time complexity, making it less efficient for larger datasets.

Graph for Time Complexity:
A graph illustrating the time complexity, particularly the relationship between input size and execution time, can be generated using the provided instructions. This graph visually depicts the less efficient nature of Selection Sort for larger input sizes.
