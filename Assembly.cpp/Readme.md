This C++ program implements an assembly line scheduling algorithm to determine the minimum time required for products to traverse through two assembly lines with multiple stations, considering the processing time at each station and the transfer time between stations.

Files:

assembly_line.cpp: The main C++ source code file containing the implementation of the assembly line scheduling algorithm.
README.md: This file, providing information about the program.
Usage:

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
Compile the source code using the command: g++ assembly_line.cpp -o assembly_line.
Run the executable: ./assembly_line.
Input:

The number of stations n.
Processing time matrix a, where a[i][j] represents the processing time at station j on assembly line i.
Transfer time matrix t, where t[i][j] represents the transfer time from station j on assembly line i to the next station.
Entry times e1 and e2 for the respective assembly lines.
Exit times x1 and x2 for the respective assembly lines.
Output:

Minimum time required for product assembly.
Path indicating the stations selected on each assembly line for minimum time traversal.
Algorithm:
The program implements the following algorithm to determine the minimum time required for product assembly:

Initialize arrays to store entry times, exit times, processing times, and transfer times.
Initialize arrays to store intermediate values for each assembly line.
Calculate the first station processing times and line selections based on entry times and processing times.
Iterate through each station, updating intermediate values based on the previous station's values and current station processing and transfer times.
Determine the minimum time and corresponding line for product exit.
Trace back the path to identify the stations selected for minimum time traversal.
Output the minimum time and the selected path.
Mathematical Algorithm:
The assembly line scheduling problem can be formulated using dynamic programming. Let f1[i] and f2[i] represent the minimum time to reach station i on assembly lines 1 and 2, respectively. The recursive equations can be defined as follows:

f1[i] = min(f1[i-1] + a[0][i], f2[i-1] + t[1][i-1] + a[0][i])
f2[i] = min(f2[i-1] + a[1][i], f1[i-1] + t[0][i-1] + a[1][i])
The final minimum time is determined as min(f1[n-1] + x1, f2[n-1] + x2). The corresponding path can be traced back using the line selection values l1 and l2.

This mathematical algorithm efficiently solves the assembly line scheduling problem by considering the optimal paths for product traversal on both assembly lines.
