This C++ program explores the time complexity differences between the recursive and iterative implementations of a power function. 
The code calculates 2^i for varying values of i and benchmarks the execution time for both recursive and iterative approaches.

Description
The program evaluates the time complexity of two different approaches to calculate the power of 2^i for varying values of i. The recursive approach uses a simple recursive function, while the iterative approach employs a loop to achieve the same result.

Differences Between Approaches
Recursive Approach
The recursive approach uses a function that calls itself for each recursive step.
It relies on the function call stack, which may lead to stack overflow for large values of n.
The code structure is more concise and resembles the mathematical definition of exponentiation.
Iterative Approach
The iterative approach utilizes a loop to iteratively calculate the power.
It avoids the risk of stack overflow and generally has better performance for larger inputs.
The code is more verbose but is often more efficient for large values of n.
