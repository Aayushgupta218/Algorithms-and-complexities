A magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. A magic square contains the integers from 1 to n2. The constant sum in every row, column and diagonal are called the magic constant or magic sum, M.

TIME COMPLEXITY = O(n^2)
